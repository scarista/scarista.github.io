### A Love Song

She’s sitting in the flashing light  
At a table with her friends  
And the way I feel the way I hurt  
I know I can’t pretend  
That it’s anything but love  
That it’s anything but love  
I feel for her

And I feel it in the night-time  
I feel it through the day  
And I just can’t remember  
If I’ve ever felt this way before

I’ve seen her on a sunny day  
And I’ve seen her in my mind  
The way she looks the way she smiles  
I know I’m going to find  
That what I feel is love  
That what I feel is love  
For her

And I feel it in the night-time  
I feel it through the day  
And I just can’t remember  
If I’ve ever felt this way before

And across the crowded dance floor  
I see her sitting on her own  
Will this be the big night  
Or just another chance I’ve blown

Then one magic moment later  
She’s dancing in my arms

Then come the final curtain  
We kissed and said “Goodnight”  
And I could tell deep down inside  
That everything was right

Now I see her in the night-time  
I see her through the day  
And I just can’t remember  
When it was any other way

*This song was recorded in 1986 and digitised in 2006. Rather shockingly, it took me until this year (2008) to do anything with it. It had to be trimmed a little at either end, normalised and then I decided to add a delay effect to change the feel of it.*

*Of course it is a bit cliched but I’m kind of fond of it because the idea was actually sparked off whilst sitting in a club somewhere, way back in college days when it seemed that someone was “falling in love” every other time a group of us students went out for beers and dancing. Can’t remember whose turn it was on this occasion. Who knows it might have been mine if I hadn’t had my head full of lyrics and potential guitar riffs.*

### Imagine A Man

Imagine a man in a light grey coat  
Sitting beneath a carnival float  
Writing short songs with the blade of a knife  
Songs about heroes and songs about life

Imagine a man in a tree in a park  
Singing his songs until it gets dark  
Songs about freedom and songs about nuts  
Songs of oppression and a pain in his guts

Songs of injustice  
Songs of love  
Songs of religions  
And the stars above

Imagine a man with a long furry tail  
A man who’s at one with the worm and the snail  
A man who writes songs with the blade of a knife  
Songs about heroes and songs about life

Songs of oppression  
Songs of love  
Tales of depression  
And the stars...

Imagine a man who plays in the grass  
Dancing on cans and broken glass  
A man who writes songs and sings to the trees  
A man who’s at one with the wind and the breeze

Imagine a man in a light grey coat  
Sitting beneath a carnival float  
A man who writes songs and sings to the trees  
A man who’s at one with the wind...

*What can you say about a song that came about as a result of a friend making an off-hand remark about a “song-writing squirrel”?*

*Well, it’s one of my oldest songs and can be traced futher back than this “definitive” 1985 version. It’s also one of my favourites because I think of it as quirky and very much not part of the mainstream.*

*This version was recorded in 1986 (again!) but has been nicely updated using my good friend Audacity and some samples from [The Freesound Project](http://freesound.org/):*

* *[forestsurroundings.mp3](https://freesound.org/people/Luftrum/sounds/48411/) by [Luftrum](https://freesound.org/people/Luftrum/), and;*
* *[Wind1.aif](https://freesound.org/people/pushtobreak/sounds/16796/) by [pushtobreak](https://freesound.org/people/pushtobreak/).*

*Their excellent work in recording these samples is much appreciated and they’ve helped to add some nice atmosphere to this recording. Thanks!*

### The Jester's Tale

Spinning lights that dance upon a stage  
A wild-eyed hero stands before the world  
The crowd are sighing crocodile tears  
As they await the Jester’s sorry tale

He’s dancing in the entrance hall  
And singing blues to the stalls  
A tear in his eye he spreads his arms  
Bows down low and cries “Goodbye”

The curtains fall for us to leave  
We see the lights begin to fade  
And in the street so far below  
The Jester cries in his Ferrari

Neon lights go whirling crazy past  
His car becomes a bright red blast  
The streets are flying the tyres burning  
And then he cries “I just can’t carry on”

From dancing in the entrance hall  
And singing blues to the stalls  
Pain’s filled his head its killed his will  
Twisted him so he’s a broken wreck

Then up ahead he sees the warning  
But carries on with no regard  
Until he hits the darkened road-end  
And his car explodes in a bloody flash

But a ghost still dances in the entrance hall  
And singing blues echo through the empty stalls  
Far out in the night his spirit is crying  
Stranded in the silver air another lost soul dying

He is gone  
The Jester is gone  
He is gone  
But still we love him

*Another favourite and yes, this one is a bit of an epic which owes it’s existence to my prog rock roots. It was written way back in 1983 and I’ve recorded it several times, this being the clearest and best performance (from 1987). I cleaned it up a bit and then added various sound effects to give it a bit more life. All of the sound effects used were obtained from [The Freesound Project](http://freesound.org/) and here are the attributions for them:*

### Touch

I’ve lost track of all these nights  
I’ve sat here on my own  
All the time that I’ve spent waiting  
For somebody to come home  
To hold me close  
To keep me warm

And just a little touch  
Would go such a long way

I’ve lost count of all the days  
I’ve struggled to get by  
All the time that I’ve spent wishing  
That I was not so shy  
That I could love  
That I could feel

And just a little touch  
Would go such a long way

And now the winter nights are drawing in  
I really need that warmth  
The warmth of another soul  
To hold me close  
To hold me tight  
And keep me warm throughout these nights

And just a little touch  
would go such a long way now

I need someone to hold me  
I need someone to love me  
And just a little touch  
Would go such a long way

*This is of the same vintage as Another Day, having originally been recorded in 1987. I used the same tools to digitise it but this one took a little more work.*

*The tracking was a bit off so I had to speed it up a tad after denoising it. Then I decided that it was way too long in its original form having an overlong intro and middle section that didn’t really add anything – instrumental breaks in acoustic numbers aren’t always the best idea.*

*So, it has been slashed from a monstrous 4m 57s down to a much more manageable and (dare I say listenable) 3m 36s. It also had to be brightened up a bit as the original recording was quite muddy.*

### This Is Rock And Roll

I know this guy called Johnny from a no hope town  
And he is really sick of all these new wave sounds  
He knows he can do better than these manicured has beens  
‘Cos Johnny’s got the talent and Johnny’s got a dream

Singing – this is rock and roll  
We’ve got the heart, we’ve got the soul  
This is rock and roll  
We’ve got the heart, we’ve got the soul

He wants to get a band together hit the music scene  
Shake it all over making everyone scream  
Take it to the outer limits take it all the way  
They’re gonna give it all they’ve got they’re really gonna play

Singing – this is rock and roll...etc

So this simple guy called Johnny from that no hope town  
He’s got it all together spreading the word around  
Telling all the stories about the people he’s known  
And how life just ain’t worth living when there’s no rock and roll

Singing – this is rock and roll...etc

I said – this is rock and roll  
We’ve got the heart and we’ve got the soul

*I trimmed about 40 seconds off the original version of this using Audacity then added some effects to freshen it up a bit. Despite the cliched lyrics I think it isn’t a bad song especially as I was trying very hard to write something with normal, accessible lyrics at the time.*

### Sacred Heart

You came here from so far away  
And I hope that you are going to stay  
Because now that I have seen your face  
Feels as if I’ve witnessed an angel’s grace

This feeling won’t go away  
I know you’re the one I need  
If only I could tell you how  
I long to hear your sacred heart beat

There has never been anyone else  
That’s made me feel so unlike myself  
I’ve been dazzled by the blazing light  
That shines from you a goddess dressed in white

This feeling won’t go away  
I know you’re the one I need  
If only I could tell you how  
I long to feel your sacred heart beat

I long to hear your sacred heart beat  
I long to feel your sacred heart beat

This feeling just won’t go away  
I hope so much that you are here to stay  
You’re the one that I really need  
And I long to hear your sacred heart beat

Next to mine

*More cliches and more trimming to make this a lot more to the point musically and a lot less indulgent.*

### Beauty And The Beast

This girl is really something  
She lights up the room  
And as she breezes in  
You can’t help but turn  
Turn and look her way  
And when she smiles you just don’t know what to say

She’s the most beautiful girl you’ve ever seen  
The original Beauty  
The most beautiful girl there’s ever been  
She’s the orignal Beauty

They say her guy’s a zero  
But he stands out in a crowd  
And as he saunters in  
You can’t help but think  
Think he’s got some kind of power  
But it’s something as dark as the midnight hour

He’s the moodiest guy you’ve ever seen  
With more than a touch of the Beast  
The moodiest guy there’s ever been  
He’s got more than a touch of the Beast

And you can’t help but wonder what she sees  
It’s a classic case of the Beauty and the Beast

*This was written and recorded in 1987. The original recording is much longer but I cut at least a minute of aimless riffing off at either end to produce the version presented here. As recordings go, it’s a bit rougher then the others and it starts rather abruptly (because of the edits) but I like the lyrics and that is why I decided to post the song.*

### Another Day

Ain’t it funny how time seems to fly  
When you’ve got something that needs to be done  
Ain’t it funny how time slips away  
When you have got errands to run  
No matter how you try  
It passes you right by  
There’s nothing left to say except  
There goes another day

Ain’t it strange how plans can go astray  
And you never get a chance to get it right  
Ain’t it strange how time seems to run  
So that day is suddenly night  
No matter how you try  
It passes you right by  
There’s nothing left to say except  
There goes another day

It’s maddening how time seems to fly  
When you’ve important things to do  
It’s frustrating how time slips away  
And how the flow is always against you  
No matter how you try  
It passes you right by  
There’s nothing left to say except  
There goes another day

Ain’t it funny how time seems to fly  
When you’ve got something that needs to be done  
Ain’t it funny how time slips away  
And you never get time to have fun  
No matter how you try  
It passes you right by  
There’s nothing left to say except  
There goes another day

Ain’t it funny how time seems to fly  
Ain’t it funny how time passes by  
Ain’t it funny how time slips away  
And you realise – that you have lost another day

*This was composed in 1985 and most recently recorded in 1987. I used Audacity to normalise it and then boost the volume after using Magix Audio Cleaning Lab to transfer it from tape and remove some hiss and tape noise.*
