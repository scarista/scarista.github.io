This is one of those books that gets right into the action, catches hold of you and before you know it is done. The very definition of a page turner, I guess.

It is the story of Michael Rogan an American officer who was tortured by the Gestapo and left for dead. His horrific experiences coupled with the death of his wife, who was taken into custody at the same time, left him with a burning desire for revenge. *Six Graves To Munich*, by [Mario Puzo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Puzo) (writing as Mario Cleri) tells us how Rogan fulfils this desire.

A quick but very enjoyable read, this is one to grab and take with you on a short flight, train journey or bus ride. It will keep you occupied until you reach your destination and help the miles fly by.

Also, it has turned my thoughts to *The Godfather* which I read a long, long, long, time ago. I suddenly feel the desire to read it again.
