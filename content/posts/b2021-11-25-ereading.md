Got myself one of these [Kobo Clara HD](https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-hd) eReaders a wee while back.

Very impressed. Much better to read on than a mobile phone. More portable than a tablet. Lots of eBooks available from Kobo. But I can also read eBooks from Google and Amazon on it. So that's great if you don't want to be tied to a particular ecosystem. There's also the option to borrow books from your local library using [OverDrive](https://www.overdrive.com/).

Screen very crisp and clear with a good resolution. Love the backlight for late night reading or dimly lit rooms.

The downside? Well, that's a perspective thing. It's such an engaging medium for reading that I find myself reading more and later at night. An excellent way to expand horizons but not so much for getting a good night's sleep.
