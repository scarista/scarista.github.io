I stood at the top of the gentle incline and studied the grazing herd. I had been tracking them for several days and was now tired and very hungry. My furs were damp and muddy, leaving me feeling cold and uncomfortable.

“Well, here goes nothing.” I raised my club above my head. Then I screamed as loudly as I could and launched myself down the slope. The club began to whistle as I whirled it through the air.

Several of the beasts looked up but, showing supreme disinterest, returned to their feeding. I was outraged that they could ignore me so.

“Swine!” I bellowed at them and forced myself to charge faster.

One of the animals, standing on the periphery of the herd, lifted its horned head and snorted in my direction. It tossed its head then turned in towards its companions.

“It’s all right,” I clearly heard it say. “It’s just that damn fool caveman again.”

The assembled beasts began to laugh.
