So I read this post, [Ready To Be Terrified?](http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/ready-to-be-terrified/), over on [Richard Wiseman’s blog](http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/) recently and thought – that’s a pretty cool idea:

> What is the best horror story you can come up with in two sentences?

And then I thought – what the hell, why not have a go at that. So I jotted down a few ultra-short tales. Followed by a few more. At which point I figured – why just restrict things to horror. And a long came a few more ideas.

And along came another thought.

Why not start publishing these little fictions on this here blog? After all I keep trying to get the blog rolling again, and again, and never really seem to get things going. Perhaps this could be a good way of building some momentum and getting the juices flowing again.

I shall give it a shot and see what happens, so check back in a day or two for the first instalment. Which will be dutifully followed by a second after a day or two more. And so on.

Oh, by the way, expect unpleasantness. At least if the first few are anything to go by.
