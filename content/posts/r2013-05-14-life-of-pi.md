[Life Of Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi) by [Yann Martel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_Martel) is a book that has intrigued me since I first saw it on the shelf of a local bookshop back in 2002, when it won the [Man Booker Prize For Fiction](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books/life-of-pi). In fact, during visits to various bookshops I’ve found myself with a copy in the pile of books I planned to buy only to swap it for something else. Then the book got made into a movie and so reading it became a lot more urgent - it looks like a movie I want to see and I prefer to read the book before seeing the film.

So, the book?

Well, you just have to wonder how things are going to develop when a young boy finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a tiger called Richard Parker for company. The fact is that the story develops in all kinds of ways as Pi and Parker find themselves at sea for 227 days. This presents Pi with a number of practical issues to overcome, the most pressing of which is to ensure he doesn’t get eaten by the tiger.

As Pi adapts to his situation, makes plans for his survival and drifts on the Pacific his story is told in a series of flashbacks. We find out about Pi’s family and their zoo, discover how he got his name and learn how he aspires to be Hindu, Christian and Muslim all at the same time. We also hear the amusing tale of how a tiger came to be named Richard Parker. Most importantly, we learn about the human spirit and the will to survive.

It’s quite an engaging tale, so much so that you start to empathise with Pi, sharing his fear, frustration and moments of triumph. Especially when he has his somewhat surreal meerkat encounter as the tale draws to a close.

This one deserves a big thumbs up and now I’m looking forward to seeing the movie.
