Whilst I’m a long way from reading all of [Patricia Cornwell’s](http://www.patriciacornwell.com/) novels I have really enjoyed those that I have read. When I picked *Port Mortuary* up it looked like it too would be a good read. It didn’t disappoint.

Kay Scarpetta finds herself enmeshed in an investigation where a range of high technologies collide. She’s been trying out some advanced autopsy techniques involving virtualisation and computed tomography and looking into how these can be used from military into civilian use. Before she knows it, she’s using these techniques to investigate the death of a young man who might still have been alive when he was placed in a mortuary cooler.

The author blends technology and whodunnit to create a tale which hooks you very early on and keeps you engrossed as the mystery unfolds. Events unfold very quickly over a short period of time which I felt heightened the tension and made for a thrilling read. And this is another read I’m happy to recommend but with one condition – it will really help if you are already familiar with the characters that inhabit Kay Scarpetta’s world. If you’re not already familiar with them it shouldn’t dull your enjoyment but you may find yourself a little confused at times. For my part it just makes me want to read more of Patricia Cornwell’s books so I can fill in the blanks.
