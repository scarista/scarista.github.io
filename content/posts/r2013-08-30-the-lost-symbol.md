It’s taken me a very long time to get round to reading [Dan Brown’s](http://www.danbrown.com/) novel [The Lost Symbol](https://danbrown.com/books/novels/the-lost-symbol/) and I know it’s a work of fiction - suspension of disbelief and all that - but:

Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh. Dear.

Some interesting ideas, some exciting scenes but I found the characters (even the long serving Robert Langdon) rather uninspiring and lifeless. Also the boundaries of belief are stretched just a bit too far with respect to the amazing achievements of noetic “science” and the Masonic symbology which seems to hold the very fabric of Washington D.C. together. And as for the last 6 chapters and the epilogue? They really just pad the book out and could easily have been condensed sparing us more nonsense about secret wisdom encoded in holy books and lost secrets of the ancients (and not so ancients).

Overall I was disappointed and can’t really give it that high a recommendation.

That said, I’ll still probably give his latest tale, [Inferno](https://danbrown.com/books/novels/inferno/), a chance to offer redemption at some point.
