To cut a long story short...

The editor provided by Github is very basic and not exactly feature rich. I decided I needed something better and browser-based so I could work from anywhere.

I tried [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) which is a decent editor but connecting it to Github wouldn't work. I looked at [JekyllPad](https://www.jekyllpad.com/) which didn't quite fit my needs. Then came [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) and a few others.

On the verge of giving up, I searched for "web-based markdown editor for github". And now, I feel a bit silly because the number one item in Google's AI Overview suggested I try " GitHub's Built-in Editor (GitHub.dev)".

Yep, the very thing I was looking for was on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) all along. And, it turns out to be a web-based implementation of Visual Studio Code - which is what I already use on the desktop.

Duh!
