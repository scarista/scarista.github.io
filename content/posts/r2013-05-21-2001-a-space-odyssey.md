I re-read [2001: A Space Odyssey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28novel%29) by Arthur C. Clarke recently because I fancied watching [Kubrik’s movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29) and wanted the book fresh in my mind for comparison - there are some pretty major differences between the two even though they were developed in parallel and took Clarke’s short story [The Sentinel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_%28short_story%29) as a starting point.

Both the book and the movie are rightly considered classic sci-fi material. The book is a quick read, weighing in at around 220 pages, but there is a lot packed into it. A mysterious monolith, an evolutionary leap, a voyage to Saturn, a conflicted computer, death, chaos, aliens and a mind-altering finale.

The movie contains all these and more. Clocking in at over 140 minutes, it is one of the most visually stunning movies you’ll ever see. The sets are amazing and the effects always make my jaw drop, especially the ground-breaking space visuals which are hugely impressive. Also notable is the lack of dialogue for much of the film with music and sound effects being used extensively instead. I think this enhances the movie by making you focus on and think about what you are seeing making it a thoroughly absorbing experience.

In short: brilliant book + utterly spectacular movie = classic sci-fi.
