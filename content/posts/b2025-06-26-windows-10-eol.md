A note I wrote to myself recently.

[Windows 10 EOL](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025-2ca8b313-1946-43d3-b55c-2b95b107f281) arrives in October. My PC's processor isn't on the supported list for Windows 11. So, what do I do? Shell out for a new processor so I can upgrade my PC to Windows 11? Buy a new PC? Or switch to Linux?

This translates to: spend £100 or so on a processor; several £100s on a new PC; or spend nothing and run Linux on what is still a perfectly good PC.

I guess I need to figure out which applications are must haves and see if they can be run on Linux (e.g. using [WINE](https://www.winehq.org)) before deciding. Unless there is a Linux version of these. Or there's an alternative Linux application that does the same job.

That said, it turns out that there is a [registry tweak](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11-2-free-options/) that will allow me to upgrade my PC to Windows 11. I think I'll explore this option first. If it doesn't work then I'll migrate to Linux. Though I say this with the thought in mind that my experiences with Windows 11 so far have not been great.
