In a recent post, I wrote about how it was time to ditch Wordpress. At that point, I didn't know what publishing tool I was going to use. This post says a bit about the option I picked (Hugo) and why.

Here are a few of my reasons for switching to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/):

* creating content is made easier by using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* content is edited locally using any text editor (my weapon of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - no more laggy online editing, yay!)
* Hugo's built-in web server lets you preview your site and updates the preview dynamically as you edit content
* the static pages generated by Hugo can be hosted pretty much anywhere and should load very quickly
* there's no back-end database to manage
* a wide selection of themes are available
* I control the content and what appears on the site, so no adverts or other stuff that might slow things down
* and so much more...

My new site just went live today and using Hugo has re-engaged me with the development process. Following their documentation got me started quickly and making the switch has been straight forward.

So thumbs up and a recommendation that you look at Hugo (or maybe another [site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/)) if you want to take back control of your own web development process.
