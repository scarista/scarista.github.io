I’ve been meaning to read [Kim Stanley Robinson’s](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info) [*Mars Trilogy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy) for a long time. A *very* long time. So, as I fancied reading a science fiction book this time round, I decided now was the time to set that ball rolling by reading Red Mars.

Red Mars tells of the colonization of Mars starting with the arrival in 2026 of “the First Hundred” aboard the space-ship *Ares*. They set about establishing the first settlement on the surface of Mars as well as an outpost inside the moon [Phobos](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/moons/phobos_%28moon%29). From these bases they prepare the way for future colonists and begin the lengthy process of [terraforming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming) the red planet.

The story then develops into something of a political thriller as various factions begin to compete for control of Mars and the resources found there. Things are not going well back home on planet Earth as ecological pressures increase as a result of overpopulation, spiralling debt and shortages of pretty much everything. More and more people want to leave for Mars but those already there are facing difficulties of their own. And so the revolution begins.

I found that I got into reading this story very quickly and was easily able to call vivid images of Mars to mind from Robinson’s descriptions. There is some quite complex interaction between the various characters and factions and these raise some very thought-provoking ideas regarding the impact humanity is having on its surroundings and that there will come a time when it is too late for us to redress the balance.

As you can imagine, technology plays an important role in this story and the author manages to convey advanced ideas simply and clearly. I was particularly impressed with the passages concerning the [space-elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) built to ease the transport of people and resources between Mars and Earth. To my mind, this clarity makes Red Mars accessible to more than just the sci-fi fans out there.

Over all impression? Red Mars is an excellent, well-paced read and I’m looking forward to the sequels Green Mars and Blue Mars.
